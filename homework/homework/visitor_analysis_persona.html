                <p>myBYUI</p>
                <p> https//my.byui.edu</p>
                <p>The worst website is https//my.byui.edu in terms of mobility. The speedhunter differs because anyone can sign up for classes at my.byui.edu on a laptop.<br>
                   However, on a smart device, the BYUI site forces you to zoom in at times to push a button on the screen of the smart device.<br>
                   The needs of the student showcases the situation in which the new student is getting to class for the first time.<br>
                   They have to login to the site, then traverse several different access points to get to their needed information.<br>
                   This is more complicated then just clicking the picture link for the article at speedhunters.
